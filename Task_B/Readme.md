# üéôÔ∏è AI Speech Processing App

##  Overview
This AI-powered Speech Processing App allows users to:
1. **Convert Text to Speech (TTS)** - Enter text, select a language, and generate AI-powered speech.
2. **Convert Speech to Text (STT)** - Upload an audio file, and the app will transcribe the speech into text.

This application uses `Gradio` for the UI, `gTTS` for text-to-speech, `SpeechRecognition` for speech-to-text, and `pydub` for audio format conversion.
